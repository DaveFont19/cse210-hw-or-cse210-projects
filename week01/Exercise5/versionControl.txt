-Explain the meaning of Version Control: The Version control is a system to make changes in a project and to register all the changes that it've had.
-Highlight a benefit of Version Control: Some of the highlights are to register all the changes and to know the course of the project, to work in harmony with the team, to update all the changes that the team makes.
-Example of version control: Describe the way version control might be used on a software development team: If I am working in a project with a team, and I finish my part of the project I can do "git commit", "git push" and all my team can have the changes using a "git pull"
-Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command): git push origin master
-Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words): Version Control is so important in software development in these days, because it helps to minimizes the problems and it helps to do faster the projects and the changes in a team. In big projects is necessary work with version control to make ensure that every contribution is reviewed and documented before being integrated into the main codebase. For example if there is a bug all the changes are make in a different branch, not in main branch. There are some platforms like Github that helps to register the version control, to store the projects and to have a update project.
